  <h2 id="Intro"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
  
   <p><u><i>Whether if its an entry-level job, or finding my next dream job/position. From the company's 
culture to opportunites for growth and recongnition, there are some things that I would never avoid 
to consider when acquiring a <b>game developer</b> job. </i></u></p> 
</div>

<div class="border">
    <h4>Company’s values align with yours</h4>
	<div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Values.jpg" alt="Company Values" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
    <p>One of the most important aspect when working in a game developing company
is how their values align with yours. This is because working for a company is about a lot more than just the hours you put in each day, which can be overwhelmingly a lot 
(more info about game developer work hours/shifts, click <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywxjmx/a-90-hour-work-week-is-believable-because-game-development-is-toxic">here</a>).
It's about knowing things you do (like integrity, hard work and honesty) and understanding how those values match up with the company and yours.     
    </p>

 <div class="border">
    <h4>The company culture fit your personality</h4>
	<div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Culture.jpg" alt="Company Culture" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
   <p>Cultural fit as well as combating against workplace descrimination should be a top priority for every company 
as each person needs to  work in a non-toxic, descriminate-free environment. From game developing companies stand-point, 
if you're comfortable in a relaxed environment than a conservative one, then an "indie-game" company would appeal more as the company tends to be more open, than a company who makes
triple A titles almost every year and competitiveness and "up to date", plays a major part of the job.

   <h4>Maintainance of a Game Project</h4>
   <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Project.jpg" alt="Game Project" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p>After production, game developers continue to handle new feature requests and make improvements to the game.
  This can include producing add-ons and game packs, making updates that introduce new levels and characters, and adding online gameplay functionality.
  Which this include either work in a small group of people or a larger depending on the content of the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)">patch</a>"</p>

   <h4>Having the chance to work abroad (in certain cases)</h4>
   <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Work.jpg" alt="Working Abroad" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
   <p>Working in the game industry will get you to travel a lot. Hosting big announcements for new releases or a party LAN in big areas in order to celebrate a milestone for a game,
   companies do tend to send ambassadors to represent and cover that event. Especially, in the game developing industry those are events are the most crucial as you tend to meet and 
   greet with a lot of people from your field as well as from various other fields (e.x cinematography, editing, game coordinator).
   </div>
   </div>
   
  <div class="border">
  <h4>Ability to Adapt</h4> 
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Adapt.jpg" alt="Adaptability" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p> The game industry throughout the years has vastly changed. In the early 90's you would need a small group of people in order to make an 8-bit game. That's not the case with 
  the current games though. Game development companies has invested in chinematography to VFX artists and designers as well as in the coding part by cutting parts into small segments
  in order for the project to progress easier. <span class="span">Having the ability to hone your skills as well as learn new in each field that you transition, will get you a long way in the industry.</span></p>

  <h4>You Get To Play Games As Part Of Your Job</h4> 
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Games.jpg" alt="Playing Games" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p>One of the perks of being a game designer is the opportunity to spend a lot of time <b>getting paid to play games</b>. This usually involves the game you’re actually designing to 
  find bugs, test new gameplay mechanics, and see how it feels. Aside from the games you’ll be working on, you also <b>get to play other titles for the purpose of studying</b>and analyzing them.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
  
  <div class="border">
  <h4>You Get To Brag About Your Job</h4>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Brag.jpg" alt="Bragging off what your are doing" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p>Any game designer who <b>says they never brag about their job is probably lying</b> through their teeth. There are few things cooler than being able to say that you make games for a living, 
  especially when today almost everyone plays games either on PC, consoles, or their smartphones. There’s nothing more satisfying than hearing people talk about your game and mentioning that you 
  actually helped make it.</p>

  <div class="border">
  <h4> Knowing that it's a Growing Industry</h4>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Growing.jpg" alt="Growing Industry" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p>It’s hard to believe that after North American video game crash of 1983, thousands of developers lost their jobs and almost every store refused to sell anything related to games.
Then along came a Japanese company named Nintendo to rekindle the fire with their Nintendo Entertainment System coupled with <b>Super Mario Bros</b>. Now fast forward to today and you’re looking at a
 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/14/league-of-legends-gets-more-viewers-than-super-bowlwhats-coming-next.html">powerful industry that rivals even that of Hollywood and television.</a></p>

  <h4>Do More Than Just Entertain</h4>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Entertainment.jpg" alt="Entertainment" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
  <p>Video games provide more than just entertainment for bored preteens. They have been crafted to help with a number of real life situations, like depression, stress, and weight problems. 
  Video games are utilized in soldier training, children’s’ schooling, and space mission preparation(take example of the most recent event with SpaceX, and their astronauts being through simulations. 
  What was once used solely as entertainment for children is now an essential tool that helps improve the world, as well as helping some individuals overcome various challenges.</p>

  <h4>Make a career out of helping people have fun</h4>
  <div class="clearfix">
  <p>
  <img class="img" src="../images/Fun.jpg" alt="Having Fun" width="355" height="200">
  </p>
   <p>Interactive entertainment is about more than just escapism into an immersive environment, whether it's a fantasy world or a sports field.
